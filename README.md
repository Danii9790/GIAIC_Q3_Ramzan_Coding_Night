# 🌙 Ramzan Coding Night 2025 – 20 Days of Code

Welcome to my **Ramzan Coding Night 2025** GitHub repository!  
This repo contains all **20 projects** completed as part of the coding challenge organized by **Sir Ashraib Ali**. The goal was to learn, practice, and build real-world Python applications throughout the holy month of Ramzan.

Each day brought a new challenge, and I explored a variety of topics including:

- Core Python concepts
- CLI applications
- File handling
- APIs with FastAPI
- Web frameworks
- Random utilities
- Streamlit for UI
- and much more!
